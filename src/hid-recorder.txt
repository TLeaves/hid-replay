NAME
----

hid-recorder - HID Input device recorder

SYNOPSIS
--------
*hid-recorder*

*hid-recorder* [OPTIONS] [/dev/hidrawX] [[/dev/hidrawY] ... ]

OPTIONS
-------

*-d, --debugfs*::
	use HID debugfs node. Some devices (like "Logitech USB Receiver" or
	"Apple Magic Mouse") grab the hidraw output, resulting in an empty output.
        In many cases relying on HID debugfs can help but if the device
        reports too many events at once (multitouch panels for example),
        the HID debugfs node will be missing a lot of events.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*hid-recorder* is a tool that allows users to capture the hidraw description
and events in order to replay them through the uhid kernel module.

When invoked without arguments, *hid-recorder* lets the user choose the
hidraw device interactively.

Several hidraw nodes can be passed to *hid-recorder*. In this case, the
recordings of each node are multiplexed using the tag *D:*, see below.

*hid-recorder* needs to be able to read from the hidraw device; in most cases this
means it must be run as root.

*hid-recorder* and *hid-replay* are used to debug kernel issues with HID input
devices. The output of *hid-recorder* has the following syntax:

- *#* lines comments
- *D:* the device we are currently working with
- *R:* size dump_of_report_descriptor_in_hexadecimal
- *N:* common_name_of_the_device
- *P:* physical_path
- *I:* bus vendor_id product_id
- *E:* timestamp size report_in_hexadecimal


EXIT CODE
---------
*hid-recorder* returns EXIT_FAILURE on error.
