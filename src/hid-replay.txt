NAME
----

hid-replay - HID Input device replay through uhid

SYNOPSIS
--------
*hid-replay* [OPTIONS] [FILENAME]

OPTIONS
-------

*-i, --interactive*::
	_interactive_ mode: This is the default mode. The device is created and
        once the user hits _enter_ the event sequence in FILENAME is played
        in real time. Once completed, the program waits for the next _enter_
        key event.

	Hit *Ctrl-C* to stop the replay.

*-1, --one*::
	_one shot_ mode: the device is created and the events are replayed
	once in real time. The process exists at the end of the replay.

*-s, --sleep X*:
	_sleep_ X seconds once the device is created before next step. Useful
	in conjunction with *--one*.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*hid-replay* requires the kernel uhid module to be loaded (available in
kernels 3.6 and later).

If the kernel module is loaded, *hid-replay* allows the user to create
virtual HID devices as if they were physically plugged to the system.
Replaying a previously recorded HID event sequence results in those events
being handled by the right HID kernel module.

*hid-replay* needs to be able to write to /dev/uhid; in most cases this means it
must be run as root.

*hid-recorder* and *hid-replay* are used to debug kernel issues with HID input
devices.

INPUT FILE
----------
The input file of *hid-replay* has the following syntax:

- *#* comments
- *D:* tell which device we are currently working with
- *R:* size dump_of_report_descriptor_in_hexadecimal
- *N:* common_name_of_the_device
- *P:* physical_path
- *I:* bus vendor_id product_id
- *E:* timestamp size report_in_hexadecimal

Any other starting characters are ignored.

CAUTION
-------
*hid-replay* is a low level events injector. To have the virtual device
handled by the right HID kernel module, *hid-replay* fakes the device on
its original bus (USB, I2C or Bluetooth). Thus, if the kernel module in use
has to write _back_ to the device the kernel may oops if the module is
trying to direclty talk to the physical layer.

Be sure to use this program with friendly HID modules that rely only on the
generic hid callbacks.

EXIT CODE
---------
*hid-replay* returns EXIT_FAILURE on error.
